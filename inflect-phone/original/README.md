# Inflect-Nano-v1

**Edit 06/17/2026** -- I'm really happy to see that this model is doing decently! If more people find it useful, I might consider training a v2 with a much larger budget. 
Inflect-Nano is #3 trending on Hugging Face's TTS leaderboard! Can it get any higher? If you would like to see a v2, just like/favourite this model to get more people see it. Thank you for everyone for checking out this model! 

**Inflect-Nano-v1 is a tiny English text-to-speech model with 4.63M total inference parameters, including its vocoder.**

It is not trying to beat large TTS models. It is a small, local, complete text-to-waveform stack built to test how far ultra-lightweight speech synthesis can go.

## Highlights

- **4.63M parameters total**
- **Includes the vocoder**
- **24 kHz audio**
- **Single English male voice**
- **Runs locally with PyTorch**
- Built for tiny-model experiments, local assistants, embedded demos, and efficient inference research

## Install

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/owensong/Inflect-Nano-v1
cd Inflect-Nano-v1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generate Speech

```bash
python inference.py --text "Wait, are you actually being for real now?" --out sample.wav
```

CPU:

```bash
python inference.py --device cpu --text "Please say neighborhood clearly." --out sample_cpu.wav
```

With simple controls:

```bash
python inference.py \
  --text "The appointment moved to 1:25." \
  --length-scale 1.03 \
  --pitch-scale 1.00 \
  --energy-scale 1.00 \
  --out sample_controlled.wav
```

Local Gradio demo:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Size

| Part | Parameters |
|---|---:|
| Acoustic model | **3.465M** |
| Vocoder generator | **1.167M** |
| Total inference stack | **4.632M** |

app.py                           local Gradio demo
```

The model itself is in `weights/`. The vendored frontend is included only so the released model can reproduce the same text normalization and tokenization path.

## What Makes It Different

Many small TTS projects depend on a separate larger vocoder. Inflect-Nano-v1 includes the vocoder in the published inference stack, so the full text-to-waveform path stays under 5M parameters.

Pipeline:

```text
text
-> English text frontend
-> compact FastSpeech-style acoustic model
-> 80-bin mel spectrogram
-> small Snake HiFi-GAN-style vocoder
-> 24 kHz waveform
```

## Architecture

The acoustic model is a compact non-autoregressive FastSpeech-style network. It predicts duration, pitch, energy, and brightness, then decodes an 80-bin mel spectrogram.

The vocoder is a small Snake-activation HiFi-GAN-style generator trained for 24 kHz waveform reconstruction.

Main settings:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---:|
| Sample rate | 24 kHz |
| Mel bins | 80 |
| Acoustic hidden size | 168 |
| Encoder layers | 5 |
| Decoder layers | 6 |
| Vocoder upsample rates | 8, 8, 2, 2 |

## Good For

- Tiny local TTS experiments
- Offline assistant prototypes
- Efficient inference research
- Embedded speech demos
- Browser/WASM-style exploration
- A baseline for sub-5M TTS work

## Not Good For

- Production narration
- Accessibility-critical output
- Voice cloning
- Multilingual speech
- High-fidelity audiobook generation
- Matching large modern TTS systems

## Limitations

This is a very small experimental model. It can sound robotic, buzzy, or unstable, especially on difficult unseen text. Long prompts and unusual phrasing are less reliable. The vocoder is also a clear quality bottleneck.

Use it as a tiny-model research/demo release, not as a production TTS engine.
